Project Rules for Cursor AI – Interactive World Simulation
Keep element behaviors modular – Each element gets its own file inside elements/.
particle_system.py acts as a manager – It should only call element update functions, not handle logic directly.
Follow structured naming conventions – Use update_<element>() for behaviors.
Keep UI and rendering separate – No physics logic should be in render.py or ui.py.
Optimize performance – Update only active elements, avoid redundant processing.
Ensure easy scalability – New elements should integrate without modifying core files.
Debug systematically – Identify all possible causes before making changes.

Code Style and Organization
- Program has a docstring header with usual contents
- Each function has a docstring describing its purpose, parameter(s) and return value:
- Program uses functions that divide the task into logical components. Functions names match the task they perform.
- Functions are of a reasonable length
- Program contains useful In-line comments.
- Variables and functions have descriptive and helpful names.
- Program is named according to usual class conventions
