# **Elemental Sandbox**  
A dynamic particle simulation where you can create and interact with various elements like sand, rain, fire, oil, and snow. Watch particles fall, flow, and react to gravity and each other in real time. Build, experiment, and explore the physics of a vibrant, interactive world!

## **Overview**  
**Elemental Sandbox** is an interactive particle simulation where users can place different elements on a grid and observe their behavior based on real-world physics.  

### **Element Interactions**  
- **Sand**: Falls and piles up.  
- **Rain**: Flows and extinguishes fire.  
- **Fire**: Spreads and burns oil.  
- **Oil**: Flows and ignites when touched by fire.  
- **Snow**: Melts into water when near fire.  

The simulation is built using Python with the `dudraw` library for visualization.

## **Features**  
✅ **Interactive Sandbox** – Place and remove particles with mouse clicks.  
✅ **Multiple Elements** – Sand, rain, fire, oil, snow, and more.  
✅ **Realistic Physics** – Particles interact with gravity and each other.  
✅ **Dynamic Interactions** – Fire spreads, rain extinguishes fire, snow melts into water.  
✅ **Customizable Grid** – Clear the grid or switch between elements easily.

## **Installation & Setup**  
Follow these steps to run the simulation:  

### **1. Install Python**  
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Install the required library using pip:  
```bash
pip install dudraw
```  

### **3. Download the Code**  
Clone or download the repository containing the project files.  

### **4. Run the Simulation**  
Navigate to the project folder and run:  
```bash
python Newman_project3part1_sandgame.py
```  

### **5. Interact & Experiment**  
Use the mouse and on-screen buttons to place particles and control the simulation.

## **Controls**  
🎮 **Left Click** – Place the selected element (sand, rain, fire, etc.) on the grid.  
🔄 **Mode Button** – Cycle through available elements (sand, rain, fire, oil, snow, floor).  
🧹 **Clear Button** – Reset the grid.  
❌ **Quit** – Press `Q` to exit the simulation.
